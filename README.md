# ECG-classification-based-on-RNN

We use two layers LSTM to achieve the classification of heartbeat arrhythmia types.


##Dataset
All the ECG data used have been obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, which is the most common data set used to design and evaluate ECG classification algorithms.
